                <p><br><br>After exuberant iterations in New York, London, Paris, and Los Angeles over the last three years, it was high time that Vogue World journeyed to Italy—and indeed, Vogue Italia announced this morning that the fifth edition of the global fashion celebration is set for September 22, 2026, in Milan.

<p><br><br>That date is deeply intentional. Vogue World: Milano will take place on the first day of Milan Fashion Week with a very clear goal: to celebrate Italian creativity; fashion as both culture and industry; and the human touch in the age of technology.

<p><br><br>“Milan has always stood for the perfect balance between craft and creativity,” says Anna Wintour, Chief Content Officer, Condé Nast, and Global Editorial Director, Vogue. “It’s a city that knows how to make the handmade feel modern and the modern feel timeless. Bringing Vogue World here will be our biggest celebration yet of fashion’s human touch.” Wintour and Vogue’s teams thank the City of Milan, represented by Mayor Giuseppe Sala and Deputy Mayor for Culture Tommaso Sacchi, and Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana for their support of Vogue World: Milano.

<p><br><br>“Milan is proud to host Vogue World in 2026,” Mayor Sala said in a release. “I would like to thank the entire Vogue family, starting with Anna Wintour, for the trust and appreciation they have shown our city by choosing it for such an important event.”

<p><br><br>The mayor continued: “Creativity, innovation, sustainability, and sartorial craftsmanship are the pillars of Made in Italy, qualities that Vogue World: Milano, with its expertise and vision, will help share and celebrate around the world.”

<p><br><br>The event will be held in the heart of the city, transforming a cultural capital that has, more than any other in Europe, demonstrated its ability to renew and reinvent itself on a global stage where fashion, art, culture, and entertainment intertwine.

<p><br><br>Since its debut, every edition of Vogue World has celebrated the culture and identity of its host city, reimagining the traditional concept of the fashion show while also supporting important and relevant causes. To date, the event has raised more than $7 million for charitable organizations supporting creative and educational communities around the world. Continuing to build on that philanthropic mission, the 2026 edition will support initiatives dedicated to Milanese craftsmanship, creativity, and cultural heritage. A dedicated committee of local institutions will help identify beneficiary organizations.

<p><br><br>Vogue World started in New York in 2022, with a vibrant street fair that helped reenergize fashion week after the COVID-19 pandemic. In London the following year, the event consisted of a spectacular evening of theater in support of that city’s performing arts community. Then, in Paris in 2024, Vogue World celebrated 100 years of fashion and sport. The most recent show took place just a few weeks ago, in Hollywood, where Vogue explored the rich conversation between fashion and film.

<p><br><br>When Milan takes center stage in 2026, it will undoubtedly bring its own distinctive attitude. “We are so excited that Milan will be the next city to host Vogue World in 2026. This extraordinary event offers a unique opportunity to celebrate with a global audience the timeless story of Made in Italy, a story of genius and craftsmanship,” says Francesca Ragazzi, Head of Editorial Content, Vogue Italia. “It feels particularly meaningful to do so at this moment in time, in the era of artificial intelligence.”
